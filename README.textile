h1. Popup Test Helper

Created by: Stefan Husch (free2b AT blun DOT org), 2009-11-13

popup_test_helper method creates HTML and Javascript code to test if popups are blocked by the browser. You might need it for dealing with 3D-Secure credit card verification.

If Javascript is turned off it will graceful degrade showing a message that 'Popups need to be allowed for 3D-Secure verification!'.

Tested on Mac with: Safari 4.0.4, Firefox 3.5.4, iCab 4.7.0, Camino 1.6.10
Tested on Windows with: 

h2. Installation

Starting from your rails application root directory:

git clone git://github.com/jfqd/popup_test_helper.git vendor/plugins/popup_test_helper

h2. Example

If you are ok with the default messages, just use the helper without parameters:

<pre><code><%= popup_test_helper() -%></code></pre>

Set your own message text:

<pre><code><%= popup_test_helper('For the following 3D-Secure verification of your credit card you need to allow Popups in your Browser!') -%></code></pre>

h2. Dependencies

None. No Prototype, no jQuery - pure Javascript

h2. Tests

How do I test this?
